	<h2>Suggestions for the <b>Manual Collections</b> Page</h2>
	<p>I set up a Shopify store to test these instructions. I found that they are clear and easy to follow; however, there are some suggestions that I would like to make in three areas: document structure, document consistency, and grammar. I will address each of these areas in the following sections.</p>
	<h3>Document Structure</h3>
	<p>The <b>What to do next</b> section does not fit within the organizational scheme of the rest of the page. Each of the other section titles begins with an imperative verb (create, add, and remove) and a clear description of the task involved in each section. <b>What to do next</b> does not provide this clear description. The contents do not seem to warrant a section of their own because they are not a complete piece of information. A more accurate title might be <b>Adding a link to your manual collection from your website navigation</b>; however, you have to navigate to another page to find that information. Also, it does not seem likely that someone will need to navigate to this section before completing the first, <b>Create a manual collection</b>. My suggestion is to incorporate this paragraph into the first section. It seems like a necessary step in creating a collection as it does not seem very useful to create a collection if customers cannot find it.</p>
	

	<h3>Document Consistency</h3>
	<p>In most cases the steps begin with either the action that you do (which is almost always to click something) or a prepositional phrase to help you locate the element you're clicking. Some of the steps break this pattern in confusing ways. Step 9 of the <b>Create a manual collection</b> section begins with a description of how products are sorted rather than the action the user is doing. This sentence is also written in the passive voice making it unclear who is adding the products. I suggest that this first sentence be written "As you add products, they are sorted alphabetically by default," and be placed as a note at the end of the step.</p>
	<p>Two further confusing examples are when a step begins with a statement of the outcome of the previous step. Steps 3 and 7 begin this way. For example, step 3 begins "The Add a collection page opens." I suggest that these statements belong at the end of the previous step.</p>
	<p>I also suggest that in the first sentence of the second paragraph of step 12 that the main clause and the conditional clause be reveresed to make it more consistent with other similarly structured sentences throughout the page.</p>
	<blockquote>If you don't want your collection to appear on your website immediately, you can set a specific publish date (known as future publishing).</blockquote>

	<h3>Grammar</h3>
