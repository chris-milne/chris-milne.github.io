	<h2>Suggestions for the <b>Manual Collections</b> Article</h2>
	<p>I set up a Shopify store to test the instructions in this article. I found that they are clear and easy to follow. There are, however, some suggestions that I would like to make in three areas: document structure, document consistency, and document completeness. I suggest that small problems in these areas creates some confusion in the instructions. I will address each of these areas in the following sections.</p>
	<h3>Document Structure</h3>
	<p>The contents listed under <b>In this article</b> give a clear sense that the organizational scheme of this page is oriented around different tasks associated with manual collections. The <b>What to do next</b> section does not fit within this organizational scheme. Each of the other section titles begins with an imperative verb (create, add, and remove) and a clear description of the task involved in each section. <b>What to do next</b> does not follow this scheme and does not provide a clear description of a task. Also, the contents do not seem to warrant a section of their own because they are not a complete piece of information. A more accurate title might be <b>Adding a link to your manual collection from your website navigation</b>; however, you have to navigate to another article to find that information. It does not seem likely that someone will need to navigate to this section before completing the first, <b>Create a manual collection</b>. My suggestion is to incorporate this paragraph into the first section. It seems like a necessary step in creating a collection as it does not seem very useful to create a collection if customers cannot find it.</p>
	
	<h3>Document Consistency</h3>
	<p>Terms and names are used very consistently in this article, but there are some places where inconsistencies in the writing make the instructions less clear. For example, in most cases the steps begin with either the action that you do (which is almost always to click something) or a prepositional phrase to help you locate the element you're clicking. Some of the steps break this pattern in confusing ways. Step 9 of the <b>Create a manual collection</b> section begins with a description of how products are sorted rather than the action the user is doing. This sentence is also written in the passive voice making it unclear who is adding the products. I suggest that this first sentence be written "As you add products, they are sorted alphabetically by default," and be placed as a note at the end of the step.</p>
	<p>Two further confusing examples are when a step begins with a statement of the outcome of the previous step. Steps 3 and 7 begin this way. For example, step 3 begins "The Add a collection page opens." I suggest that these statements belong at the end of the previous step. Each step should be a complete action and to have them overlap like this makes it less clear where one step ends and another begins.</p>
	<p>I also suggest that in the first sentence of the second paragraph of step 12 reversing the main clause and the conditional clause to make it more consistent with other similarly structured sentences throughout the page:</p>
	<blockquote>If you don't want your collection to appear on your website immediately, you can set a specific publish date (known as future publishing).</blockquote>

	<h3>Document Completeness</h3>
	<p>There are a few places where I felt that more information would help make this article more complete. The first thing that seems to be missing is that the preview neither defines a manual collection nor states the purpose of the article. I suggest that this paragraph could be revised as follows:</p>
	<blockquote>You can create collections manually and add or remove products from them. You have to add products one by one in the admin for manual collections or the collection will always contain the same products.</blockquote>
	<p>The bullet list would then follow more clearly from the description and give a clearer sense of the purpose of the article.</p>
	<p>The <b>Add a product to multiple manual collections</b> section does not provide enough information about how to accomplish this. There should be steps that describe what you have to do rather than just a screen shot. Screen shots are very useful for augmenting the information provided in the text, but I don't think they can entirely replace it. I believe this may also be an issue for accessibility.</p>
	<p>In the <b>Remove products from a manual collection</b> section, the link doesn't work properly. When I click on it nothing happens and if I open it in a new tab, it just goes to the top of this article rather than to another topic. It seems as though it should go to another page about information pages.</p>
	<p>These small issues are not a huge problem for understanding these instructions, but I think that the goal should be to make them impossible to misunderstand. I hope that my suggestions can help with that goal.</p>
