	<h2>Suggestions for the <b>Manual Collections</b> Page</h2>
	<p>I set up a Shopify store to test these instructions. I found that they are clear and easy to follow; however, there are some suggestions that I would like to make in three areas: document structure, document consistency, and grammar. I will address each of these areas in the following sections.</p>
	<h3>Document Structure</h3>
	<p>The <b>What to do next</b> section does not fit with the organizational scheme of the rest of the page. Each of the other section titles begins with an imperative verb (create, add, and remove) and a clear description of the task involved in each section. <b>What to do next</b> does not provide this clear description. The contents do not seem to warrant a section of their own because they are not a complete piece of information. A more accurate title might be <b>Adding a link to your manual collection from your website navigation</b>; however, you have to navigate to another page to find that information. Also, it does not seem likely that someone will need to navigate to this section before completing the first, <b>Create a manual collection</b>. My suggestion is to incorporate this paragraph into the first section as it does not seem very useful to create a collection if customers cannot find it.</p>
