	<h2>Suggestions for the Manual Collections Page</h2>
	<p>I set up a store on Shopify and tested these instructions. I found that they are clear and easy to follow. There are some suggestions that I would like to make in three areas though: document structure, document consistency, and grammar. I will address each of these areas in the following sections.</p>
	<h3>Document Structure</h3>
	<h3>Document Consistency</h3>
	<h3>Grammar</h3>
